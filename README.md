1.Introduction 
Dataset: The dataset contains information about individuals and their heart health parameters. It includes 303 rows, each representing a different individual, and 17 columns covering various features such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar, resting electrocardiographic results, maximum heart rate achieved, exercise-induced angina, ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest, the slope of the peak exercise ST segment, and the target variable indicating the presence of heart disease.
The objective is predicting the presence of heart disease based on the provided health parameters. This is a classification problem, where the target variable is binary (0 for no heart disease, 1 for heart disease).
